# Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR)
***
### Insecure Direct Object References (IDORs) are a type of security flaw that arises when an application allows users to directly access internal objects or resources by manipulating input parameters.
### This vulnerability occurs when proper access controls are not implemented, enabling attackers to modify input values to gain unauthorized access to sensitive data or functionalities.
**Note**: IDOR vulnerabilities where notably highlighted in the OWASP 2007 top ten list. They represent just one instance of numerous implementations errors that can lead to circumvention of access controls and compromise system security.
