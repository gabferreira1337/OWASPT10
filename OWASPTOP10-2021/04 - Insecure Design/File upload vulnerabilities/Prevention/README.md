# Preventing File Upload Vulnerabilities
***

### Extension Validation
#### Although whitelisting file extensions is a more secure practice, it’s advisable to use both whitelisting and blacklisting together. By implementing a whitelist to specify which extensions are allowed and a blacklist to block potentially harmful ones, you create a layered defense. This dual approach helps mitigate risks if the whitelist is somehow circumvented (for example, if a file named shell.php.jpg is uploaded). The example below demonstrates how to apply this strategy in a PHP web application, but the same principle can be adapted to other frameworks as well.

```php
$fileName = basename($_FILES["uploadFile"]["name"]);

// blacklist test
if (preg_match('/^.+\.ph(p|ps|ar|tml)/', $fileName)) {
    echo "Only images are allowed";
    die();
}

// whitelist test
if (!preg_match('/^.*\.(jpg|jpeg|png|gif)$/', $fileName)) {
    echo "Only images are allowed";
    die();
}
```
#### In file upload security, blacklisting and whitelisting are used differently. Blacklisting involves checking if the file name contains any forbidden extensions anywhere in the name, while whitelisting checks if the file name ends with an allowed extension. Additionally, it's important to implement both back-end and front-end validation for file uploads. Although front-end validation can be bypassed, it helps prevent users from uploading unintended files in the first place. This can trigger defense mechanisms and potentially send alerts about suspicious activity.


### Content Validation
#### Validating only the file extension is insufficient; it's crucial to also check the file's content. Both the extension and content must be validated together to ensure security. Additionally, the file extension should match the file's actual content.

````
$fileName = basename($_FILES["uploadFile"]["name"]);
$contentType = $_FILES['uploadFile']['type'];
$MIMEtype = mime_content_type($_FILES['uploadFile']['tmp_name']);

// whitelist test
if (!preg_match('/^.*\.png$/', $fileName)) {
    echo "Only PNG images are allowed";
    die();
}

// content test
foreach (array($contentType, $MIMEtype) as $type) {
    if (!in_array($type, array('image/png'))) {
        echo "Only PNG images are allowed";
        die();
    }
}

### Upload Disclosure
#### To enhance security, it’s important to prevent direct access to the uploads directory and the uploaded files. Instead of allowing users to access files directly, it's best to use a controlled download mechanism.
#### Implement a script, such as download.php, to handle file retrieval. This script should manage file access and serve the requested files to users, effectively keeping the uploads directory hidden. This approach helps mitigate the risk of users directly accessing or executing potentially malicious files.


### Further Security
#### To further secure the back-end server against potential threats, even if initial precautions are bypassed, we can implement several additional measures.
#### One key configuration involves disabling specific PHP functions that could be used to execute system commands through the web application. In the php.ini configuration file, you can use the disable_functions directive to restrict functions such as exec, shell_exec, system, and passthru, among others.
#### Additionally, it is important to disable the display of system or server errors to prevent the exposure of sensitive information. Errors should be handled at the application level, providing generic messages that avoid revealing details about file paths, directories, or the underlying system.
#### Here are some more recommendations for enhancing web application security:
* **Restrict File Upload Sizes**: Set limits on the maximum allowed file sizes for uploads.
* **Keep Libraries Up-to-Date**: Regularly update any libraries or dependencies used in the application to address vulnerabilities.
* **Scan Files for Malware**: Implement scanning procedures to detect and handle potentially harmful files or malicious content.
* **Use a Web Application Firewall (WAF)**: Employ a WAF as an additional layer of defense to protect against various web threats.
