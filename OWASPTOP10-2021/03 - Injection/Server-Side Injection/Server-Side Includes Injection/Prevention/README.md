# Preventing SSI Injection
***
#### To prevent SSI (Server-Side Includes) injection vulnerabilities, developers need to meticulously validate and sanitize any user input, especially when it is used in SSI directives or written to files that could contain these directives based on the web server's configuration. It's also crucial to configure the web server to limit the use of SSI to specific file extensions and, if possible, restrict it to certain directories. Additionally, reducing the functionality of certain SSI directives can further mitigate the risks associated with SSI injection. For example, disabling the exec directive when it is not necessary can help minimize potential security threats.
