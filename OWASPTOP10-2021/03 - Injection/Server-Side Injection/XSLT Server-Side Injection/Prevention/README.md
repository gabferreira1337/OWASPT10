# Preventing XSLT Injection
***
#### To prevent XSLT injection, it's crucial to avoid inserting user input directly into XSL data before it's processed by the XSLT processor. However, if the output needs to reflect user-provided data, that data might need to be included in the XSL document. In such cases, it's essential to properly sanitize and validate the input to prevent XSLT injection attacks. This helps stop attackers from injecting malicious XSLT elements, though the specific approach might vary depending on the output format.
#### For example, if the XSLT processor is generating an HTML response, HTML-encoding the user input before including it in the XSL data can effectively prevent XSLT injection. HTML-encoding converts characters like < to &lt; and > to &gt;, making it difficult for an attacker to insert harmful XSLT elements, thereby protecting against XSLT injection.
#### Further security measures include running the XSLT processor with minimal privileges, disabling the use of external functions (such as PHP functions within XSLT), and regularly updating the XSLT library. These steps can reduce the potential damage from XSLT injection vulnerabilities.
