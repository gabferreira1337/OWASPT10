# Weak Brute-Force Protection
***
### Rate Limits
#### Limitation of rates is a technique in software creation and network administration that regulates the frequency of incoming requests to a system or API with the aim of preventing system overload due to excessive requests at any given time and reducing brute force attacks impact.. By establishing a limit on the quantity of requests permitted within a period of time interval. rate limiting plays a role in preserving system stability. Guarantee equitable distribution of resources, among all users. It also serves as a shield against misuse like denial of service (DoS) attacks or excessive use, by one client by setting a limit on the number of requests allowed.
#### When a brute force attack occurs and the rate limit is reached the attack is essentially thwarted by either slowing down response times or temporarily restricting the attackers access rendering the attack impractical.
#### In a scenario on the web or in applications online it's best if rate limiting is directed towards bad actors only and not innocent users to prevent any unintentional Distributed Denial of Service (DoS) situations from happening by mistake. Most strategies for detecting attackers focus on their IP addresses; however things get tricky when there are entities like proxies or load balancers, in the mix that can mask the real source IP address making it harder to pinpoint the actual offender. To work around this challenge in cases systems often turn to examining HTTP headers like `X-forwarded-for` to figure out where the actual source of a request is coming from.
#### There's a risk involved in this approach. A malicious actor could tweak HTTP headers such as `X-forwarded-for` to skirt around the rate limit set in place. By changing up the header value for each request randomly the attacker can fly under the radar. Persist with their brute force assault. These types of weaknesses are fairly widespread, in cybersecurity scenarios, as demonstrated by [CVE-2020-35590](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-35590).

### CAPTCHAs
#### Preventing bots from submitting requests can be prevented by using a **Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart (CAPTCHA)** . CAPTCHAs help prevent automated scripts from performing malicious actions, such as spamming forums creating fake accounts, or launching brute-force attacks on login pages. While ***CAPTCHAs*** serve an essential purpose in deterring automated abuse, they can also present usability challenges for some users, particularly those with visual impairments or specific cognitive disabilities.
