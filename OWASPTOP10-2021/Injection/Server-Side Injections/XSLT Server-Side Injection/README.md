# [Extensible Stylesheet Language Transformations Server-Side Injection (XSLT)]()
***
#### XSLT (Extensible Stylesheet Language Transformations) server-side injection is a vulnerability that occurs when attackers manipulate XSLT transformations carried out on the server. XSLT is used to convert XML documents into other formats, like HTML, often for dynamic content generation in web applications. If vulnerabilities exist in how these transformations are processed, attackers can inject and execute arbitrary code on the server, potentially leading to severe security issues such as unauthorized access or server compromise.
