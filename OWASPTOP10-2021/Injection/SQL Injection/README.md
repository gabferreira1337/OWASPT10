# SQL Injection (SQLi)
***
### **SQL injection** (**SQLi**) is a cybersecurity thread wherein an attacker manipulates the input fields of a web application to inject malicious SQL code into the database queries. By doing this so, the attacker can gain unauthorized access to sensitive date, modify or delete records, and potentially compromise the entire application or server. 
## Detecting SQL injection vulnerabilities
### To manually detect SQLi vulnerabilities in a web application, a systematic set of tests can be conducted on each entry point:
* Test with a single quote char `(')` to identify potential errors or anomalies in the application's response.
#### **Example** :
